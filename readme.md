# Go Mimic

Mimic is an end to end network simulation tool for the Hive blockchain. It provides a modular, and easy to use localnet with end to end validation and JSON RPC APIs identical to that of Hive mainnet

ðŸš§**Mimic is Under Active Development**ðŸš§

## Capabilities

- Create test accounts using a specified list of public keys and metadata
- Update account metadata or public keys via mock transactions
- Perform real world transactions against a mock environment, respecting signature validation, balance validation, and transaction expiration

## Getting Started

In case you don't have the binaries installed locally. A `compose.yml` file is
given for MongoDB, exposing the default port `27017`.

```sh
docker compose up
```

Start the mimic server

```sh
go run ./cmd/main.go
# or with Makefile
make
```

### Supported Transactions

Not all transactions are supported on Mimic. However, we have implemented the following transactions deemed most important for application development:

- `custom_json` ðŸš§
- `account_update` ðŸš§
- `account_update2` ðŸš§
- `transfer` ðŸš§
- `transfer_from_savings` ðŸš§
- `transfer_to_savings` ðŸš§

### Supported API Calls

**Hive APIs**

- `account_history_api.get_ops_in_block` ðŸš§
- `block_api.get_block` âœ…
- `block_api.get_block_range` âœ…

**Mimic APIs**

- Admin create account / modify keys ðŸš§
- Admin transaction ðŸš§
- Admin reset block database

**Virtual Ops**:

### Limitations

- Mimic does not currently support creation posts, comments, likes, proof of brain or other social related activties
- Mimic does simulates witness scheduling in ideal conditions, block production may not completely match real world conditions.
- Mimic does not currently support authority delegation. Transactions created using authority delegation will fail
- Mimic may have not implemented all error types or may not be able to simulate all types of error returned from Hive RPC API.
- Mimic does not simulate resource credits
- Mimic does not simulate Hive Power
