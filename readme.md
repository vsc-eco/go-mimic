# Go Mimic

Mimic is an end to end network simulation tool for the Hive blockchain. It provides a modular, and easy to use localnet with end to end validation and JSON RPC APIs identical to that of Hive mainnet

ðŸš§**Mimic is Under Active Development**ðŸš§

## Capabilities

- Create test accounts using a specified list of public keys and metadata
- Update account metadata or public keys via mock transactions
- Perform real world transactions against a mock environment, respecting signature validation, balance validation, and transaction expiration

### Supported Transactions

Not all transactions are supported on Mimic. However, we have implemented the following transactions deemed most important for application development:

- `custom_json` ðŸš§
- `account_update` ðŸš§
- `account_update2` ðŸš§
- `transfer` ðŸš§
- `transfer_from_savings` ðŸš§
- `transfer_to_savings` ðŸš§

### Supported API Calls

**Hive APIs**

- `account_history_api.get_ops_in_block` âœ…
- `block_api.get_block` âœ…
- `block_api.get_block_range` âœ…
- `condenser_api.broadcast_transaction` ðŸš§
- `condenser_api.broadcast_transaction_synchronous` ðŸš§
- `condenser_api.get_dynamic_global_properties` âœ…
- `condenser_api.get_current_median_history_price` âœ…
- `condenser_api.get_reward_fund` âœ…
- `condenser_api.get_withdraw_routes` âœ…
- `condenser_api.get_open_orders` âœ…
- `condenser_api.get_conversion_requests` âœ…
- `condenser_api.get_collateralized_conversion_requests` ðŸš§
- `condenser_api.get_accounts` âœ…
- `rc_api.find_rc_accounts` ðŸš§
- `/health` âœ…

**Mimic APIs**

In order for the admin API server to listen on port 3001, the environment variable `ADMIN_TOKEN`
must be exported.

- Admin create account âœ… / modify keys ðŸš§
  - `broadcast_ops.account_create`
- Admin transaction ðŸš§
- Admin reset block database

**Virtual Ops**:

- Claim HBD savings ðŸš§

### Limitations

- Mimic does not currently support creation posts, comments, likes, proof of brain or other social related activties
- Mimic does simulates witness scheduling in ideal conditions, block production may not completely match real world conditions.
- Mimic does not currently support authority delegation. Transactions created using authority delegation will fail
- Mimic may have not implemented all error types or may not be able to simulate all types of error returned from Hive RPC API.
- Mimic does not simulate resource credits
- Mimic does not simulate Hive Power

## Getting Started

### Exported environment variables

- `ADMIN_TOKEN`: optional, hex string of 64 random bytes, only needed to start the admin API server.
  - if `openssl` is installed, use `openssl rand -hex 64` to generate the token.
- `LOG_LEVEL`: optional, defaults to `info`, can be set to `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`.

go-mimic will also try to load variables from a `.env` file as well.

### Using Makefile

Run the following to start the Mongo Docker container and the mimic server:

```sh
make dev
```

> **Note:** This is for development only and requires [`air`](https://github.com/air-verse/air) for hot-reloading.

### Manual Setup

If you don't have the necessary binaries installed, use the provided `compose.yml` to start MongoDB (default port `27017`):

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

Then, start the mimic server:

```sh
go run ./cmd/main.go
```
